.. _installation-guide:

Installation
------------

To install `rt_api`, run:

.. code::

    pip install rt_api

Alternatively rt_api can be installed from source by cloning the repository
and running setuptools:

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/NickMolloy/rt_api
    cd rt_api
    python setup.py install



Using `rt_api`
---------------

The main entry point for the library is the `Api` class.
Instantiating this class will give access to all of the API functionality.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

   from rt_api.api import Api

   api = Api()  # Instantiate api. Generates default access token.
   latest_episodes = api.episodes()  # Get an iterable of the latest episodes
   newest_episode = next(latest_episodes)
   print(newest_episode.title)  # Print out episode title
   show = newest_episode.show  # Get a reference to the show the episode is from
   print(show.name)  # Print out name of the show

If you want to be able to perform actions as a specific user, you must first
authenticate:

.. code-block:: python

   from rt_api.api import Api

   api = Api()
   api.authenticate("myUsername", "myPassword")  # Authenticate as myUsername

From this point, all actions performed will be done in the context of that user.
For instance, the current user is available through the ``me`` attribute of the api:

.. code-block:: python

    my_user = api.me  # Get the user object associated with the authenticated user
    my_user.queue  # Get the current user's episode watch list


For more information on the available actions, see the
`package documentation <https://rt-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rt_api.html>`_,
or some `examples <https://rt-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_.
